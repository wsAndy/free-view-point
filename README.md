free view-point video
--------------------

Free view-point video is the next video style that people could choose a special view for them to watch video.

This project is a temporary one in 2017 and is just used for the author to test some similar aglorithms like `SFM` (structure from motion) and how to use `IDE` (Qt creator3.3.0) to control git.

The original purpose is only use `color image` as input while most papers/algorithm use `color image` and `depth image`.
