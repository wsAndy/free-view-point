The algorithm is from `View generaton with 3D warping using depth information for FTV`

Free view-point video is the next video style that people could choose a special view for them to watch video.

This project is a temporary one in 2017 and is just used for the author to test some similar aglorithms like `SFM` (structure from motion) and how to use `IDE` (Qt creator3.3.0) to control git.

The original purpose is only use `color image` as input while most papers/algorithm use `color image` and `depth image`.

dataset
---
The dataset is download from [here](https://download.microsoft.com/download/6/F/B/6FBC4A82-443A-44F2-99F1-835F2C2E4379/3DVideos-distrib.zip), which was generated by the Interactive Visual Media group at Microsoft Research and is widely used in free viewpoint research.


attention
-----
The core process is slow and the algorithm is still a navie one without any accelerate.


how to use
---
1. build : in `free-view-point`, use `./build.sh`
2. run : in `free-view-point/Example/vgftv/` use `./ftv`
